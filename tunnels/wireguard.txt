	git clone https://github.com/adrianmihalko/wg_config
add a user
	./user.sh -a alice
delete a user
	./user.sh -d alice

	./user.sh -v alice

Default UDP port 51820

Install
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireguard/wireguard
	apt install wireguard-dkms wireguard-tools
Create a private key
	(umask 077 && printf "[Interface]\nPrivateKey = " | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf > /dev/null)
	wg genkey | sudo tee -a /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf | wg pubkey | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/publickey
We will need to exchange the key in this file (/etc/wireguard/publickey) with the second server as we define our configuration.

Open configuration file
	sudo vim /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
Configuring the Interface Section
We need to define the VPN IP address this node will use and the port that it will listen on for connections from peers
[Interface]
PrivateKey = generated_private_key
ListenPort = 5555
SaveConfig = true

We will use the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet as the address space for our VPN.
For each computer, you will need to pick a unique address within this range (10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.254)
and specify the address and subnet using CIDR notation.
Address = 10.0.0.1/24

/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf on second server
[Interface]
PrivateKey = generated_private_key
ListenPort = 5555
SaveConfig = true
Address = 10.0.0.2/24

Add a peer to the server.
Since we know the specific IP address that the first server is using,
we can input that directly, ending with /32 to indicate a range that contains single IP value:
/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf on second server
[Peer]
PublicKey = public_key_of_first_server
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.1/32
Endpoint = public_IP_of_first_server:5555

To route to the server LAN:
AllowedIPs = 192.168.2.1/24, 192.168.1.1/24

To route all traffice to server:
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0

Add the following to the server config:
PostUp   = iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

Opening the Firewall and Starting the VPN
	sudo ufw allow 5555
Now, start the wg-quick service using the wg0 interface file we defined:
	sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0
This will start of the wg0 network interface on the machine. We can confirm this by typing:
	ip addr show wg0
We can use the wg tool to view information about the active configuration of the VPN:
	sudo wg

To complete the connection, we now need to add the second server's peering information to the first server using the wg command.
On the first server:
	sudo wg set wg0 peer public_key_of_second_server endpoint public_IP_of_second_server:5555 allowed-ips 10.0.0.2/32
You can confirm that the information is now in the active configuration by typing sudo wg again on the first server:
	sudo wg
Ping the second server
	ping -c 3 10.0.0.2
If everything is working correctly, you can save the configuration on the first server back to the /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf file by restarting the service:
	sudo systemctl restart wg-quick@wg0
If you want to start the tunnel at boot, you can enable the service on each machine by typing:
	sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0

Mobile Client
Share a configuration file (see ~/qrcode.txt)
	qrencode -t ansiutf8 < tunner.conf
