Configuring the virtual network device
run addtap.bat in tinc's installation directory.
This will add a new virtual network device. (If you want to run more than one tinc daemon, you will need to create extra virtual network devices.)

After that, open the Network and Dial-up connections control panel,
and change the name of the new interface to the same as you specified in tinc.conf, 
in our case to tap0.

Then, double-click on the new interface. 
You can enable the icon in the taskbar if you want.
Click on Internet Protocol and then on Configure.
Manually set the address to that of your computer on the VPN, in this example 10.20.40.1.
The subnet mask should be set to that of the entire VPN, in this example 255.255.0.0.

Starting tinc

Now that everything has been set up, it is time to start tinc.
Start command.com, go to tincâ€™s installation directory and start tinc with the right -n option:
	tincd -n dvdnet
If everything went well, it will tell you that it installed itself as a service and started it.

You can temporarily stop and start tinc from the Service control panel.
