	systemctl - list all loaded units and their state (where unit is the term for a job/service)
	systemctl list-units - list all units
	systemctl status [NAME...] - service status
	systemctl start [NAME...] - start (activate) one or more units
	systemctl stop [NAME...] - stop (deactivate) one or more units
	systemctl disable [NAME...] - disable one or more unit files
	systemctl list-unit-files - show all installed unit files and their state
	systemctl --failed - show which units failed during boot
	systemctl --type=mount - filter for types; types could be: service, mount, device, socket, target
	systemctl enable debug-shell.service - start a root shell on TTY 9 for debugging 
	
	systemctl enable telnet.sockets
	systemctl enable telnet

For more convinience in handling units, there is the package systemd-ui, which is started as user with the command systemadm.

Switching runlevels, reboot and shutdown are also handled by systemctl:
    systemctl isolate graphical.target - take you to what you know as init 5, where your X-server runs
    systemctl isolate multi-user.target - take you to what you know as init 3, TTY, no X
    systemctl reboot - shut down and reboot the system
    systemctl poweroff - shut down the system 

All these commands, other than the ones for switching runlevels, can be executed as normal user.

Basic Usage of journalctl
With systemd, logs are aggregated in the journal which resides in /var/log/.
To be able to make full use of the journal, we first need to set it up,
as Debian does not do that for you yet:
	# addgroup --system systemd-journal
	# mkdir -p /var/log/journal
	# chown root:systemd-journal /var/log/journal
	# gpasswd -a $user systemd-journa
That will set up the journal in a way where you can query it as normal user.
Querying the journal with journalctl offers some advantages over the way syslog works:
	journalctl --all - show the full journal of the system and all its users
	journalctl -f - show a live view of the journal (equivalent to "tail -f /var/log/messages")
	journalctl -b - show the log since the last boot
	journalctl -k -b -1 - show all kernel logs from the boot before last (-b -1)
	journalctl -b -p err - shows the log of the last boot, limited to the priority "ERROR"
	journalctl --since=yesterday - since Linux people normally do not often reboot, this limits the size more than -b would
	journalctl -u cron.service --since='2014-07-06 07:00' --until='2014-07-06 08:23' - show the log for cron for a defined timeframe
	journalctl -p 2 --since=today - show the log for priority 2, which covers emerg, alert and crit; resembles syslog priorities emerg (0), alert (1), crit (2), err (3), warning (4), notice (5), info (6), debug (7)
	journalctl > yourlog.log - copy the binary journal as text into your current directory 
Journal and syslog can work side-by-side. On the other hand,
you can remove any syslog packages like rsyslog or syslog-ng once
you are satisfied with the way the journal works.

For very detailed output, append "systemd.log_level=debug" to the kernel boot-time parameter list, and then run:
	# journalctl -alb 
Log levels can also be edited in /etc/systemd/system.conf.

Analyzing the Boot Process with systemd
systemd allows you to effectively analyze and optimize your boot process:
	systemd-analyze - show how long the last boot took for kernel and userspace
	systemd-analyze blame - show details of how long each service took to start
	systemd-analyze critical-chain - print a tree of the time-critical chain of units
	systemd-analyze dot | dot -Tsvg > systemd.svg - put a vector graphic of your boot process (requires graphviz package)
	systemd-analyze plot > bootplot.svg - generate a graphical timechart of the boot process
