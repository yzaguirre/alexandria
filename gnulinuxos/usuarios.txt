Create user

	# useradd -d /var/www/juan -s /bin/false juan
	# passwd juan
	
	# mkdir -p /var/www/{juan,paco,luis,pedro}/doc
	# chown -R juan /var/www/juan

	adduser usuario sudo
	
Remove password
	# passwd -l user

To find information on any account that's tied to a user with the name Jones.
	$ grep Jones /etc/passwd 

	$ getent passwd
This command retrieves entries from certain administrative databases,
including the account database. In most cases, typing getent passwd produces
results that are identical to typing cat /etc/passwd; however, sometimes the
two aren't identical. The /etc/passwd file defines only local user accounts. It's
possible to configure Linux to use a network account database to define some
or all of its accounts. If you use such a configuration, typing getent passwd
returns both local accounts and accounts defined on the network server.

If you want to create files that are associated with another group to which you belong,
you can use the newgrp command, as in:
	$ newgrp project1
This command makes project1 your current group, so that files you create
will be associated with that group. 
Other commands
	$ who -q
	$ id 
	$ whoami
	$ w
	$ last
Create account with
	$ useradd
o tambien
	$ adduser
Ejemplo
	$ adduser -c "David Y. Gonzalez" -e 2014-12-31 -d /home/david -g ftp -s /bin/bash dvdyzag
	$ useradd -c "David Y. Gonzalez" -e 2014-12-31 -d /home/david -g users -s /bin/bash david
	$ adduser -c "David Y. Gonzalez" --home /home/david --group users --shell /bin/bash david

The superuser, however, can pass a username to the command to
change any account's password:
	# passwd pamela

Para Ubuntu 13.10
	# adduser -c "David Yzaguirre Gonzalez" --home /home/dvdyzag2 -u 1001 -gid 100 dvdyzag2
	# adduser -c "David Yzaguirre Gonzalez" --home /home/david -u 1000 -gid 100 david
	# passwd david
	# usermod --login david --home /home/david --gid 100 dvdyzag
	Change home, name, default gid

Deleting Accounts	
If you want to avoid any chance of confusion or claims of misbehavior fall-
ing on new users because of UID or GID reuse, you can use the find command
to locate all files with particular UID or GID values, using the -uid and -gid
options, as in:
	# find / -uid 1004
The userdel command deletes accounts from a text-mode shell. In its simplest
form, you pass it a username and nothing more:
	# userdel pamela
To both force account deletion and remove the user's files:
	# userdel -rf pamela
You can create groups from the shell using the groupadd command
	# groupadd grinko
Append a group
	# usermod -aG vboxusers david

To modify existing groups, you have three options:

 The usermod command includes the --groups (-G) option to alter
  group membership on a user-by-user basis. You can use this feature
 to adjust who is a member of particular groups.

 You can use the groupmod command. You can use the --gid (-g)
  and --non-unique (-o) options from Table 14.3 with this com-
 mand, as well as --new-name name (-n name), which changes the
group's name. You cannot, however, change group membership with
 groupmod.

 You can directly edit the /etc/group file, which stores the group
  definition. This option is sometimes handy if you want to add several
 users to a new group; however, it's a bit risky, since a stray keypress
  could damage the file.

Deleting groups from the shell entails use of the groupdel command, which takes
a group name as a single option, as in 
	# groupdel gingko
to delete the gingko group.

Modify shell
	usermod -s /bin/sh www-data
Avoid login
	usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin www-data
	passwd -l www-data
