The following command copies an ISO image file from a CD or DVD to your USB
flash drive (assuming the drive appears as /dev/sdb1):
	$ sudo dd if=whatever.iso of=/dev/sdb9
Note that this command is making a binary copy of the bytes in the file, which may
not be what you want to do.

Make a ISO
	dd if=/dev/cdrom of=whatever.iso
Ubuntu also creates /dev/cdrw and /dev/dvd devices files as well as
/dev/cdrom.

Find the offset sector, two ways:
	file mydevice.img # Look for startsector
	fdisk -l mydevice.img # Look for Start column
Multiply the offset sector by 512. Each sector is 512 bytes long
	mount -o ro,loop,offset=32256 mydevice.img /mnt/any_mount_directory
