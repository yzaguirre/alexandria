TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a popular image file format. Unlike other types of image files, a tiff file can contain multiple images (e.g., multi-page document scan) in it. Tiff editor software such as GIMP is able to support such multi-page tiff files. If you would like to convert a tiff file to pdf format on Linux, you can follow the instructions below.

A simple way to convert a tiff image to a pdf document is to use a command-line utility called tiff2pdf.
In order to install tiff2pdf on Debian or Ubuntu:
	apt install ghostscript libtiff-tools
In order to install tiff2pdf on CentOS or RedHat:
	yum install ghostscript libtiff

In order to install tiff2pdf on Fedora:
	yum install ghostscript libtiff-tools

If you have installed tiff2pdf, you can convert a tiff image to pdf format as follows.
	tiff2pdf -o output.pdf input.tiff

If you would like to extract specific pages from a tiff image and convert them into a pdf file, what you can do is to convert the whole tiff file into a pdf using the above method, and then edit the pdf file to your needs.
