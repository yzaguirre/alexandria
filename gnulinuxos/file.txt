Fine Free File Command
The file command is "a file type guesser", that is, a command-line tool that tells you
in words what kind of data a file contains.
Unlike most GUI systems, command-line UNIX systems - with this program leading the charge -
don't rely on filename extentions to tell you the type of a file, but look at the file's actual contents.
This is, of course, more reliable, but requires a bit of I/O.
