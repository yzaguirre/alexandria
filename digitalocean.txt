The DigitalOcean API allows you to manage Droplets and other resources within the DigitalOcean cloud in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP requests. 

1. Log in to the DigitalOcean Control Panel.
2. Follow the API link in the main navigation.
3. Click the Generate New Token button.

Then, on the New personal access token form:

- Enter the token name. This is for your own reference.
- Select the scope.
- Then click the Generate Token button.

Your token will be generated and presented to you on your Personal Access Tokens page.

	export TOKEN=77e027c7447f468068a7d4fea41e7149a75a94088082c66fcf555de3977f69d3

Get list of actions
List all of the actions that have been executed on the current accoun
	curl -X GET "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/actions" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" 
List all Droplets
	curl -X GET "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets?page=1&per_page=1" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
Create a New Droplet. The following example creates an Ubuntu 16.04 Droplet called "My-Droplet" in the NYC3 data center, with 512MB RAM:
	curl -X POST "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets" \
        -d'{"name":"My-Droplet","region":"nyc3","size":"512mb","image":"ubuntu-14-04-x64"}' \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json"
	curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -d '{
	"name": "HelloFromTerminal",
	"region": "nyc3",
	"size": "s-1vcpu-1gb",
	"image": "wordpress-20-04",
	"backups": false,
	"ipv6": false,
	"user_data": null,
	"private_networking": null,
	"volumes": null,
	"tags": [
		"this is a tag"
	]
}' "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"

For a full list of attributes that must be set to successfully create a Droplet, see the full documentation:
https://developers.digitalocean.com/v2/#create-a-new-droplet

Grab the IP address of the droplet
	curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets/227936008"

Create Multiple Droplets
	curl -X POST "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets" \
        -d'{"names":["sub-01.example.com","sub-02.example.com"],"region":"nyc3","size":"512mb","image":"ubuntu-16-04-x64"}' \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
Power On a Droplet
	curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -d '{"type":"power_on"}' "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets/3164450/actions"

List SSH keys
curl -X GET \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
