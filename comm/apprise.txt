Apprise - Push Notifications that work with just about every platform!

	sudo -H pip install -U apprise

Send a notification to as many servers as you want
as you can easily chain one after another (the -vv provides some
additional verbosity to help let you know what is going on):
	apprise -vv -t 'my title' -b 'my notification body' \
   'mailto://myemail:mypass@gmail.com' \
   'pbul://o.gn5kj6nfhv736I7jC3cj3QLRiyhgl98b'

If you don't specify a --body (-b) then stdin is used allowing
you to use the tool as part of your every day administration:
	cat /proc/cpuinfo | apprise -vv -t 'cpu info' \
   'mailto://myemail:mypass@gmail.com'

The title field is totally optional
uptime | apprise -vv \
