	apt install znc
	znc --makeconf
Follow the guides to setup the server. I mostly choose the defaults, and enabled all the modules

Now you can run ZNC as that user and verify it works, and make tweaks to the config.
	vim .znc/configs/znc.conf
or with the webadmin module by pointing a browser to
	https://yourhostname:6664

How To Install ZNC, an IRC bouncer, on an Ubuntu VPS
Basic Usage
Your ZNC web interface should be available at: http://<droplet_ip>:<specified_port>
or if you used SSL https://<droplet_ip>:<specified_port>,
you can sign in with your user and password to configure ZNC further.
More help on configuring ZNC further can be found over here.

You can connect to your ZNC account via an IRC client of your choice
by trying
	/server <droplet_ip> <specified_port> <user>:<pass>
	/server <znc_server_ip> +5000 znc-admin:<pass>
	/server <znc_server_ip> +5000 david:<pass>
within your client, however this command is client dependent.

It's a good idea to use username/network:password as the password in your client,
so that (even for broken clients) ZNC can figure out which user you are connecting as.

SSL
http://wiki.znc.in/Signed_SSL_certificate
	cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.org/{privkey,cert,chain}.pem > znc.pem
	cat domain.key signed.crt lets-encrypt-x1-cross-signed.pem > znc.pem
You should also generate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange parameters, also appended to znc.pem:
	openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 2048
	cat dhparam.pem >> znc.pem
