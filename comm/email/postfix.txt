Install
	apt install postfix
# Email Aliases
Add a user
	adduser user2
	passwd user2
Go to config directory
	cd /etc/postfix
	vim alias
user: user, user2
admin: user
secretary: user2

Add a user per mailbox
	adduser admin
	adduser secretary
But they won't receive an email, because they're not on the list of aliases

Make postfix pick up the aliases
	postalias /etc/postfix/aliases
aliases.db is created

# Install and Configure an SMTP Service
	vim /etc/postfix/main.cf
myorigin = mail.mylabserver.com
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, mail, mail.mylabserver.com # Send mail locally instead of relay

Edit transport file for lan transfers
	vim transport
mail local:
mail.mylabserver.com local:
.mail local:
.mail.mylabserver.com local:

With local resolution, edit /etc/hosts
	vim /etc/hosts
52.3.220.14 mail.mylabserver.com mail

Create another database when add transport
	postmap /etc/postfix/transport
Reads mail.cf and transport. It also tells us of any error. It also overrites database, so back it up before any new configuration.
Edit subnet in mynetworks section

# Restrict access to SMTP
Edit main.cf, there are 4 options to choose from
	vim main.cf
# require HELO or EHLO
smtpd_helo_required = yes
# Restrictions for senders, reject requests for any outbound destination
# reject any non local destinations fro sender address
smtpd_sender_restrictions = permite_mynetworks, reject_unknown_sender_domain
# Reject any HELO or EHLO identification after introduction
# reject anything that has a bad domain or network addresss
smtpd_helo_restrictions = permite_mynetworks, reject_invalid_helo_hostname
# Reject any request unless it has: is finaldestination or postfix is the mail forwarder
# reject anything for mail forwarding and non-destinations
smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permite_mynetworks, reject_unauth_destination

Now recreate the db
	postmap /etc/postfix/transport

How to set up a mail server on a GNU / Linux system
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6748670
http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/
1.   Install telnet for testing purposes
	zypper install telnet
2.	 Now open the main Postfix configuration file by typing:
	vim /etc/postfix/main.cf
3.	 First of all we will want Postfix to listen on all interfaces. So scroll down and update
the following line that starts with inet_interfaces to read:
	inet_interfaces = all
4.	 With the intention that this server may become a domain-wide mail server you should
now update the following line that starts with mydestination to read:
	mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain
5.	 We now need to specify the pathname of a mailbox file relative to a user's home
directory. To do this, scroll down and locate the line that begins with home_mailbox
and uncomment the following option:
	home_mailbox = Maildir/
6.	 Now scroll down and make sure that the following line remains commented out:
	#mail_spool_directory = /var/spool/mail
7.	 Now save and close the file in the usual way before restarting the Postfix service
as follows:
	service postfix restart
8.	 Having finished the basic configuration of Postfix we will now proceed to test the MTA
with Telnet. To do this, we will begin by opening a Telnet session in the following way:
	telnet localhost smtp
10.	 Now type the following:
	ehlo localhost
11.	 Having done this, your server should respond as follows:
	250-servername.localdomain
	250-PIPELINING
	250-SIZE 10240000
	250-VRFY
	250-ETRN
	250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
	250-8BITMIME
	250 DSN
12.	 We will now send a message. So replace the <username> value with a valid system
account and type the following command:
	mail from:<username>
	mail from:david
13.	 Now press the Enter key and the terminal will respond in the following way:
	250 2.1.0 Ok
14.	 Now replace the <recipient> value with either a valid user account or a third party
e-mail address and type the following command:
	rcpt to:<recipient>
	rcpt to:david
15.	 Press the Enter key to continue and the terminal should respond as follows:
	250 2.1.5 Ok
16.	 Now type the following command in order that we can create a simple message:
	data
17.	 The terminal will now respond as follows:
	354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
18.	 Now type your message. Remember to keep it simple, so you could type:
	Hello, this is a test message.
19.	 When you complete typing, press the Enter key and use a . key to finish the process
as follows:
	.
20.	 On success, the terminal should respond in the following way:
	250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as 6A35D19F61A
21.	 To quit the Telnet session, type:
	quit
22.	 At this stage your first e-mail should be on route to its destination, meanwhile the
terminal will now respond as follows:
	221 2.0.0 Bye
	Connection closed by foreign host.

Having done this, you should have received a test message and as a result you will be happy
to know that everything is working correctly. However, if you did happen to encounter any
errors you should always refer to the log file located at /var/log/maillog.

Building a local POP3/SMTP server with Postfix and Dovecot
1.	 To do this, log in as root and install Dovecot by typing the following command:
	zypper install dovecot
2.	 Once installed, enable the Dovecot service at boot by typing:
	# chkconfig dovecot on
3.	 Now open the main Dovecot configuration file in your favorite text editor by typing:
	vim /etc/dovecot/dovecot.cf
or change file extension
	vim /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf
4.	 Begin by confirming the protocols we want to use by un-commenting the
following line:
	protocols = imap pop3
5.	 Now save and close the file in the usual way before opening the following file in your
favorite text editor:
	vim /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf
6.	 Scroll down and uncomment the following line:
	mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
7.	 Again, save and close the file in the usual way before opening the following file in your
favorite text editor:
	vim /etc/dovecot/conf.d/20-pop3.conf
8.	 Start by uncommenting the following line:
	pop3_uidl_format = %08Xu%08Xv
9.	 Now scroll down and amend the following line:
	pop3_client_workarounds = outlook-no-nuls oe-ns-eoh
10.	 Save and close the file in the usual way. In our final configuration setting we will now
allow for plain text logins. To do this, open the following file in your favorite text editor:
	vim /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf
11.	 Change the following line to state:
	disable_plaintext_auth = no
12.	 Now scroll down and ensure the following line reads:
	auth_mechanisms = plain
13.	 Now, save and close the file before starting the Dovecot service:
	service dovecot start

Make Alias
	vim /etc/aliases
#users aliases for mail
marketing: 	henry

Repeat this action for all aliases, but when you have finished, remember to save and close the
file in the usual way before running the following command:
	newaliases
