https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/66560/mutt-smtp-tls-error-sending-mail
When using smtp submission on port 587,
the value for smtp_url should start with "smtp://", i.e. not with "smtps://".
It is also important to make sure ssl_starttls is set to "yes",
as correctly done in the config above.

Install
	apt install mutt
Note that Mutt will recognize by default two locations for its configuration file; ~/.muttrc and ~/.mutt/muttrc

Password safety
Create a file in a secure environment since it will contain your passwords for a couple of seconds: 

Now encrypt the file
	gpg -aer 'your-name' -o ~/.my-pwds.gpg
set my_pw_personal = ****
set my_pw_work = ****

Back to your account dedicated files, ~/.muttrc
set imap_pass=$my_pw_personal

And in your .muttrc, before you source any account dedicated file:
	source "gpg -dq $HOME/.my-pwds.gpg |"

Configure mutt by editing /etc/Muttrc. You also need to configure sendmail to allow for sending e‐mail.
Like mail, mutt can also be used to send a message from a script. mutt also adds the
capability to send attachments. For example:
	mutt -s "My Linux Version" -a /etc/lsb-release \
		chris@example.com < email-body.txt
	mutt -s "My Linux Version" -a /etc/lsb-release \
	chris@example.com < /dev/null
You can begin your mutt mail session (assuming your default mailbox is $MAIL) by
simply typing mutt:
	mutt

a - After exiting the message body, type a to add an attachment, if you like.
? - To see other ways of manipulating your message, headers, or attachments.
y - To send the message or q to abort the send.
x - To exit without changing your mailbox when you are done.
q - To exit and incorporate the changes you made (messages read, deleted, and so on).

If you know
the address of your mail server, here are examples of how to connect to a POPS or
IMAPS e‐mail server from mutt:
	mutt -f imaps://chris@imapsserver.example.com
	mutt -f pops://chris@popsserver.example.com
