Install
	apt install mutt
Note that Mutt will recognize by default two locations for its configuration file; ~/.muttrc and ~/.mutt/muttrc

Password safety
Create a file in a secure environment since it will contain your passwords for a couple of seconds: 

Now encrypt the file
	gpg -er 'your-name' -o ~/.my-pwds.gpg
set my_pw_personal = ****
set my_pw_work = ****

Back to your account dedicated files, ~/.muttrc
set imap_pass=$my_pw_personal

And in your .muttrc, before you source any account dedicated file:
	source "gpg -dq $HOME/.my-pwds.gpg |"

Configure mutt by editing /etc/Muttrc. You also need to configure sendmail to allow for sending e‐mail.
Like mail, mutt can also be used to send a message from a script. mutt also adds the
capability to send attachments. For example:
	$ mutt -s "My Linux Version" -a /etc/lsb-release \
		chris@example.com < email-body.txt
	$ mutt -s "My Linux Version" -a /etc/lsb-release \
	chris@example.com < /dev/null
You can begin your mutt mail session (assuming your default mailbox is $MAIL) by
simply typing mutt:
	$ mutt

? - To see other ways of manipulating your message, headers, or attachments.
y - To send the message or q to abort the send.
x - To exit without changing your mailbox when you are done.
q - To exit and incorporate the changes you made (messages read, deleted, and so on).
