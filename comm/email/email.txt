By the way, keep in mind that SMTP encryption is just protection on transit:
it doesn't hide the email content from any mail server in the path and
it does not do anything to authenticate the sender.

Email is perfect for what it is, it's a textual, non-realtime medium of communication.
You take the time to compose a long, coherent message using written language.
Mail has existed for a long time, and hopefully it will never go away.

Text-based mail clients can be used to read mail already downloaded by
other mail clients. For example, you could open your Evolution mail Inbox file by
typing
	mail -f $HOME/.evolution/mail/loc/Inbox

The oldest command, and easiest to use when you just want a quick check for mes-
sages in the root user’s mailbox on a remote server, is the mail command (/bin/mail),
part of the mailutils package.

Install
	apt install mailutils
Examples
	mail -s 'My Linux version' chris@localhost < /etc/lsb-release
	ps auwx | mail -s 'My Process List' root@localhost
The subject (-s) is set to 'My Linux Version'.
Used interactively, by default the mail command opens the mailbox set by your cur	rent shell's $MAIL value.

The current message has a greater-than sign (>) next to it. New messages have an N at
the beginning, unread (but not new) messages have a U, and if there is no letter, the
message has been read. The prompt at the bottom (&) is ready to accept commands.

At this point, you are in command mode. You can use simple commands to move
around and perform basic mail functions in mail. Type the following to enact these
functions:

?—To see a list of commands
The number of the message - To see that message
v3 - Opens the third message in the vi editor
h18 - To see a list of message headers that begins with message 18.
r7 - To reply to message 7 (type your message, and then put a dot on a line by itself to send the message)
d4 - To delete the fourth message (or d4-9 to delete messages four through nine)
!bash - To escape to the shell (then exit to return to mail)

Before you exit mail, know that any messages you view will be copied from your
mailbox file to your $HOME/mbox file when you exit, unless you preserve them (pre*).
To have all messages stay in your mailbox, exit by typing x. To save any messages
you have already viewed to the mailbox, type q to exit.

You can open any file that is in MBOX format when you use mail. For example, if you
are logged in as one user, but want to open the mailbox for the user chris, type this:
	mail -f /var/mail/chris
