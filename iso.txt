Burn a ISO
	wodim dev=/dev/cdrw image.iso
In addition to the device name and image file, wodim supports a very
large set of options. Two common ones are -v for verbose output and -dao,
which writes the disc in disc-at-once mode. This mode should be used if you
are preparing a disc for commercial reproduction. The default mode for
wodim is track-at-once, which is useful for recording music tracks.

There are several ways to do this, but here are just two ways that I use regularly. Please replace /dev/sr1 with the device identifier of your target drive (find out what it is with inxi -d), and replace myiso with your iso and its disk location if necessary.
    wodim -eject -tao speed=2 dev=/dev/sr1 -v -data myiso.iso

    growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/sr1=myiso.iso

More information about the read and write capabilities of your drive can be found with the following command, again substututing my example /dev with your device identifier:
	wodim -prcap dev=/dev/sr1

For more options relating to wodim and growisofs, see their respective manpages, by entering man wodim and man growisofs. (Note: wodim is a fork of the original cdrecord program)

Use the following command to locate your DVD drive:

wodim --devices

cdrecord
	cdrecord speed=4 -eject --dev=/dev/sr0 /tmp/BOOT-CD.iso
