The most versatile way to manage containers locally
miniboss is a Python application for locally running
a collection of interdependent docker services,
individually rebuilding and restarting them,
and managing application state with lifecycle hooks.
Services definitions can be written in Python,
allowing the use of programming logic instead of markup.
