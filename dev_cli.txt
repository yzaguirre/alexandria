	pip install dev-cli
Please note before using that you should put your API key in the DEV_API_KEY environment variable. If you prefer, when starting the program will also look for a .env file in the working directory.

	python -m dev_cli publish ~/dev/dev-blog/test.md
	python -m dev_cli publish -k title ~/dev/dev-blog/test.md
