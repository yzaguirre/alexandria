Generating your keys
	apt update && apt install openssl
2. Generate a 1024-bit RSA private key and save it to a file:
	mkdir -p /etc/ssl/{private,newcerts,certs,requests,CA}
	cd /etc/ssl
	openssl genrsa -out private/site1.key 2048
In higher-security environments, encrypting the key by adding the -des3 argument
after the genrsa argument on the openssl command line is a good idea:
	openssl genrsa -des3 -out private/site1.key 2048
Finally change the file mode
	chmod 600 private/site1.key
3. You are asked for a passphrase, which is needed every time you start Apache.

Create Certificate Sign Request CSR
	openssl req -new -key -sha256 private/site1.key -out requests/site1.csr
6. If you don't plan to have your certificate signed, or if you want to test your configura-
tion, create the self-signed certificate and save it in a file named server.crt:
(not used, but is self-signed using the sign request)
	openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

The above command will prompt you to enter the passphrase. Once you enter the correct passphrase,
your certificate will be created and it will be stored in the server.crt file.

Generate the crt directly from the private key:
	openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -key private/site1.key -out certs/site1.crt
When private key does not exist:
	openssl req -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout www.blackmoreops.com.key -out www.blackmoreops.com.crt

Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]: .
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]: .
Locality Name (eg, city) []: .
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:TEST USE ONLY
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:TEST USE ONLY
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:secure.example.org
Email Address []:dom@example.org

8. Verify sha256 hash function in self-signed x509 digital certificate
	openssl x509 -noout -text -in www.blackmoreops.com.crt 

Summary
	mkdir -p /etc/ssl/{private,newcerts,certs,requests,CA}
	cd /etc/ssl
	openssl genrsa -des3 -out private/site1.key 2048
	chmod 600 private/site1.key
	openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -key private/site1.key -out certs/site1.crt
