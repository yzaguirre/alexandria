In case anyone that doesn't follow the development of the library closely missed it,
the main improvement in this version is the introduction of ECC support.
ECC tends to be able to provide equivalent levels of security as traditional "big prime" cryptography (like RSA) with less computationally intensive operations.
This is especially important in a library like OpenPGPjs that is primarily meant for in browser based web usage because it should make things,
like sending and receiving mail, faster when ECC is used over older PGP public key encryption systems.

For people that use ProtonMail's web based crypto on mobile or tablet devices,
a switch to ECC would result not just in similar performance improvements but also in lower battery usage.
