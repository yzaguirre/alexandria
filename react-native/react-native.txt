https://reactnativecode.com/install-react-native-on-mac/
For MacOS
	brew update
	brew install node
	brew install watchman
	brew install cocoapods
For new versions
	brew upgrade node
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59410402/webpacker-error-while-creating-ruby-on-rails-app
	gem uninstall yarn
	brew install yarn

Install on Windows
	npm install -g expo-cli
	expo init --template blank --name AwesomeProject AwesomeProject
	cd AwesomeProjectn
	npm start
or	expo start

Share app
https://www.reddit.com/r/reactnative/comments/die05b/sharing_app_in_development_with_client/
Apple Testflight, Google Play Store Beta and Alpha releases.
Do not bother with binaries to clients. Especially if they aren't very technical.
https://medium.com/@jamischarles/easily-share-a-react-native-app-during-development-d40ac27af6ef
Create an account at:
https://expo.io/signup
	export EXPO_CLI_PASSWORD=mypassword # somewhere, maybe .bashrc
	expo-cli login -u user
	cd project
	expo-cli publish
Share the link
Any time you need to show another update, you can
	exp publish
again, and the same url will work.
So simple, so useful to show your work in progress.
