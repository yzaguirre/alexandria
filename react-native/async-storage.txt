An asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system for React Native
https://aboutreact.com/react-native-asyncstorage/
AsyncStorage can only be used to store small values in the form of
a key and value pair because it has some limitations to store the data.
You can store your value with respect to any key and then can access
the value using the key again. It works perfectly on
both platforms (Android and IOS).
