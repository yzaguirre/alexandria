Android is terrible.
The best thing to do is piggy back zebra crossing's open source app
and integrate it directly into the app. But as for a general use scanner,
Android still depends on the user to download a external app.
Motorola has it built into their camera app but I feel users don't
know and don't reach out for it on reflex.
