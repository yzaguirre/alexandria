Setup location provider
GPS PROVIDER
This provider determines location using satellites. Depending on conditions such as connectivity, climatic conditions, etc., this provider may take a while to return a fixed location. It requires the permission android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION.

NETWORK_PROVIDER
This provider determines location based on the availability of cell tower and Wi-Fi access points. Results are retrieved by means of a network lookup. Requires either of the permissions android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION or android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION.

The permission you choose determines the accuracy of the location returned by the FusedLocationProviderClient API.

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>

Create location services client
In your activity's onCreate() method, create an instance of the FusedLocationProviderClient, which is the main component that interacts with the fused location provider.
