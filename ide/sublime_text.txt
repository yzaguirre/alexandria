Adding a Line
To add the line above or below to the selection, use Ctl+Alt+Up and Ctrl+Alt+down (OS X: Ctrl+Shift+Up and Ctrl+Shift+Down).
If you go too far, use Undo Selection (Ctrl+U, or Command+U on OS X) to step backwards.

Splitting the Selection into Lines
Select a block of lines, and then split it into many selections, one per line, using Ctrl+Shift+L, or Command+Shift+L on OS X.

Quick Add Next
To add the next occurrence of the current word to the selection, use Quick Add Next, which is bound to Ctrl+D on Windows and Linux, or Command+D on OS X.
Again, if you go too far, use Undo Selection (Ctrl+U, or Command+U on OS X) to step backwards.
Individual occurrences can be skipped via Quick Skip Next, which is bound to Ctrl+K,Ctrl+D on Windows and Linux, or Command+K,Command+D on OS X.

Find All
To add all occurrences of the current word to the selection, use Find All: Alt+F3 on Windows and Linux, or Ctrl+Command+G on OS X.
