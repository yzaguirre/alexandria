WKD is both more secure than HKP (as it's always over HTTPS and authenticates user's domain),
it's enabled by default in a growing number of email clients (Enigmail, GPG for Outlook, KMail)
and providers (kernel.org [1], posteo.de),
it's used by GPG when locating a key and the setup is incredibly easy
(just put binary key in one location).
