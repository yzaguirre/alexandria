Use a gpg server
https://help.riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/best-practices
	apt-get install gnupg-curl
	cd /etc/ssl/CA
	wget https://sks-keyservers.net/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem
https://sks-keyservers.net/verify_tls.php
	vim ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
keyserver hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
keyserver-options ca-cert-file=/etc/ssl/CA/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem
keyserver-options no-honor-keyserver-url

Updates to keys can be published to public key servers, including new signatures. You can periodically update your keys by using
update key in my keyring
	gpg --refresh-keys
	gpg --keyserver keyserver --refresh-keys searchterm # Search term can be key ID or string; if left out, updates entire keyring. Used to check for new sigs and revocations.
Now that you've updated keys from a keyserver, you might want to see who has signed your key.
After all, anyone can sign any key and re-upload that key to a key server.
You can see the signatures with the --list-sigs command to gpg:
	gpg --list-sigs your@email.address 

If you signed a pub key, export that change to keyserver
send key to key server (and update new signs and revocations)
	gpg --keyserver keyserver --send-keys 0xCFD7010E
search keys
	gpg --keyserver keyserver --search-keys searchterm # Search by key ID (prefixedwith "0x") or string.
receive key from key server, use keys.gnupg.net
	gpg --keyserver keys.mozilla.org --recv-keys 0x29846B3C683686CC
