ssss is an implementation of Shamir's secret sharing scheme for UNIX/linux machines.
It is free software, the code is licensed under the GNU GPL v2.
ssss does both: the generation of shares for a known secret and the reconstruction of
a secret using user provided shares.
The software was written in 2006 by B. Poettering,
it links against the GNU libgmp multiprecision library (version 4.1.4 works well)
and requires the /dev/random entropy source.

	tar xf ssss-0.5.tar.gz

Usage
The generation of shares given a known secret is shown first.
A (3,5)-threshold scheme is used, that is: 5 shares are generated,
the secret can be reconstructed by any subset of size 3.
	ssss-split -t 3 -n 5
These shares can be combined to recreate the secret:
	ssss-combine -t 3
