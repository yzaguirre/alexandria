	apt -t testing install yadm

	vim $HOME/.yadm/encrypt
.ssh/*.key

Use Asymmetric Encryption
	yadm config yadm.gpg-recipient <recipient-address>

The yadm encrypt command will find all files matching the patterns, and prompt for a password.
Once a password has confirmed, the matching files will be encrypted and saved as $HOME/.yadm/files.gpg.
The patterns and files.gpg should be added to the yadm repository so they are available across multiple systems.

	yadm add .yadm/encrypt
	yadm add .yadm/files.gpg
	
To decrypt these files later, or on another system run
	yadm decrypt
and provide the correct password.
By default, any decrypted files will have their "group" and "others" permissions removed.
