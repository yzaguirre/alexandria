Qt4 is the default Qt dependency,to build against Qt5,pass "-DQT5=true" to cmake
To build the backends as well as front ends,run the following command
	cmake -DQT5=true -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE . ..
For Raspberry pi
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DNOGUI=yes -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE . ..
Volumes by default are mounted in "/run/media/private/$USER".A compile time option of "-DHOMEMOUNTPREFIX=true" will cause volumes to be mounted
instead in user's home directory.
	make
	# make install
After you have it installed,run "zuluCrypt-test" to make sure everything is working as expected.
