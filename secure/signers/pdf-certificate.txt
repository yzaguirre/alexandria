Just print to pdf, copy to remarkable, sign, email back to sender.
Way easier than printing, signing, scanning, and then emailing back.

In those cases I usually take the PDF, open it with LibreOffice
and paste over my signature, scanned once upon a time.
Never got any complaints, but it could be easily discovered for sure.
