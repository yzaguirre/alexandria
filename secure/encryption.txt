reop (https://github.com/tedu/reop). The cryptography is done by libsodium and it is well-written.
NetPGP (http://www.netpgp.com/). The cryptography is done by the OpenPGP SDK. The NetPGP code is well-written but the OpenPGP SDK code looks like OpenSSL.

In order to encrypt a file with gpg use:
	$ gpg -c filename
This command reads the passphrase interactively and generates filename.gpg. In
order to decrypt a gpg file use:
	$ gpg filename.gpg
This command reads a passphrase and decrypts the file.

Base64 is a group of similar encoding schemes that represents binary data in an
ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. The base64
command can be used to encode and decode the Base64 string. In order to
encode a binary file into the Base64 format, use:
	$ base64 filename > outputfile
Decode Base64 data as follows:
	$ base64 -d file > outputfile
Serve the Base64 as image
$DATA=$(base64 filename)
<img src="data:image/png;base64,$DATA" />
