You may also need Java, but you must figure out what you need. 
Most users will only need OpenJRE and the Java browser plugin:
	# apt-get install icedtea-7-plugin openjdk-7-jre
For development, you'll also want OpenJDK
	# apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk

If for various reasons, you need Oracle Java (the package includes JDK, JRE and the browser plugin), 
you can install Oracle Java 7 by using the following commands:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer

Create jar file
	jar c[v0Mmfe] [manifest] [jarfile] [entrypoint] [-C dir] inputfiles [-Joption]
	$ cd bin
	$ jar cfe JBubbles.jar gt.dvdyzag.JBubbles acercade gt imagenes
