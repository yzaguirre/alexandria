	sudo -H pip3 install jupyterlab
Optional libraries
	sudo -H pip3 install tensorflow pandas scipy
Check version
	jupyter notebook --version
https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html
	jupyter notebook --generate-config
Start JupyterLab
https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1318
	unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
	jupyter lab
Visit http://localhost:8888/
Because JupyterLab is a server extension of the classic Jupyter Notebook server,
you can also use JupyterLab by starting the classic Jupyter Noteboook
	jupyter notebook
and visiting the /lab URL (usually http://localhost:8888/lab) rather than the default /tree URL.
Conversely, to go to the classic Notebook from JupyterLab, you can change the URL from /lab to /tree
