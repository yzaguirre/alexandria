Using arp-scan on a Subnet
A good place to begin is to run a complete scan of your local network. You must run the arp-scan tool as root.
	arp-scan --localnet
Use the -I option to specify which network device with which you're scanning.
	arp-scan --localnet -I eno1
Specify the network interface and the subnet.
	arp-scan -I eth0 192.168.1.0/24
Unknown devices are not necessarily rogue; they are simply not in the arp-scan vendor databases.
To identify a device, you can use one of the online MAC finder sites.
For example, one of Apple, Inc.'s Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUI) is 10:dd:b1

Alternatively, you can update the arp-scan databases.
There are two methods for updating the databases. The first method, is:
	cd /usr/share/arp-scan
	sudo get-iab -v -u http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/iab/iab.txt
	sudo get-oui -v -u http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/oui.txt
This process might fail. If it does, use second method:
	cd /usr/share/arp-scan
	sudo wget http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/oui.txt
	sudo wget http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/iab/iab.txt
Also, the second method delivers the updates in a format that cannot be used by arp-scan directly.
You have to convert it:
	sudo get-iab -u
	sudo get-oui -u file:///usr/share/arp-scan/oui.txt

The final scenario that I use arp-scan for is in finding duplicate IP addresses.
	sudo arp-scan -I enp0s3 192.168.1.0/24 | grep -i dup
