chrony replaces ntpd as the recommended NTP server in Ubuntu 18.04.
Though the default Ubuntu system is set up to use systemd-timesyncd
for simple sync needs, ntpd would often be required for more demanding
time synchronization or to provide network time services for other
clients.
In 18.04 ntpd has been demoted to the universe repo,
and is unavailable without updating your APT configuration.
