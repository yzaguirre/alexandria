Netplan is a simplified interface for configuring Linux networking,
where YAML files in /etc/netplan are used to generate configuration
information for either NetworkManager or systemd-networkd.
	man systemd-networkd.service
	man systemd.network

Print a summary of your network devices
	networkctl
Print the state of each IP address on the system
	networkctl status
	
The ip link set command is a replacement for ifup and ifdown.
