ruby-build installs a non-Homebrew OpenSSL for each Ruby version installed and these are never upgraded.
To link Rubies to Homebrew's OpenSSL 1.1 (which is upgraded) add the following
to your ~/.zshrc:
	export RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)"
Note: this may interfere with building old versions of Ruby (e.g <2.4)
that use OpenSSL <1.1.

Install a ruby version
	rbenv install 3.0.0
	rbenv install 2.7.2
Installs shims for all Ruby executables known
to rbenv (i.e., ~/.rbenv/versions/*/bin/*).
Run this command after you install a new version of Ruby,
or install a gem that provides commands.
	rbenv rehash
	echo $GEM_HOME
Ruby versions at ~/.rbenv/versions
	rbenv versions
Display current version
	rbenv version
Lists all available versions of Ruby
	ruby-build --definitions

Choose a ruby version in your scripts file (.zshrc, .zprofile, .bashrc, .profile)
	export RBENV_VERSION=2.7.2
Or
	rbenv shell 2.7.2
Unset it
	rbenv shell --unset

Ruby already has the ability to spin up a quick webserver for the current directory. This is supported through the un file in Ruby's stdlib: http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/un/rdoc/Object.html.

    ruby -run -e httpd -- --port=8080 .
	ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5000
