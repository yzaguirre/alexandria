If you are going to do this on a regular basis then you should set up dual cathode bars
to hang your bars from and an anode bar down the center.
Use several nickel bars, 3 on each side.
Use copper tomake your cathode and anode bars with solid connections ( bolt/nut)
so not to over work both the power supply/rectifier with heat/resistance at the connection points.
This will give you better results. Use powder pumice to scrub your parts first before degreasing.
Any water used with the pumice would be better if  distilled.
A lot of things will plate better if a layer of copper is put on first.
But it will not always last as long as copper seems to let loose sooner on some metals.
Steel bumpers that are nickel plated also have a thin layer of chrome over
the nickel to stop corrosion or rust from forming.
