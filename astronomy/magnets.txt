Just some info for anyone that has not studied up on the impact
rating of your average Neo magnets.
That is not really a cheap magnet.
The Neo's that come out of China are some of the best in the world.
Neodymium magnets are not designed to take high impact or to be hit together.
They are made from a 5-7 micro-fine compound pressed and heat-treated then coated for oxidization.
They will break the same way potted metal or any other metal that is pressed at such a fine particulate compound.
That is normal.
This style of Neo magnet is designed for attracting and holding metal objects at a much higher weight per sqr inch
than the same size magnet as your normal everyday magnets.
If you want magnets that are designed to take high impacts you have to purchase a high impact Neodymium magnet
they start at around $500.00 for a 4' square.
