Custom git command aliases can be placed in ~/.gita/cmds.yml.

Repo paths are saved in ~/.gita/repo_path

white: local branch has no remote branch
green: local branch is the same as remote branch
red: local branch has diverged from remote branch
purple: local branch is ahead of remote branch (good for push)
yellow: local branch is behind remote branch (good for merge)
