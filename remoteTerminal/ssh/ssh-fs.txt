 Using the SSH filesystem (sshfs), you can mount any directory from an SSH
server that your user account can access from your local Linux system. sshfs pro-
vides encryption of the mount operation as well as of all the data being transferred.

Install sshfs software
	# apt-get install sshfs
Create mount point
	$ mkdir /var/tmp/chris
a√±adirse al grupo fuse

	# gpasswd -a $USER fuse
Mount remote directory
	$ sshfs chris@10.0.0.5:/home/chris /var/tmp/chris
When you are done using the remote directory, you can unmount it with the fuser-
mount command (part of the fuse-utils package):
	$ fusermount -u /var/tmp/chris
