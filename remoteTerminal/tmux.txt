Install
	apt-get install tmux
If you're using OpenBSD, tmux is part of the base system. 
For the rest of us, we need to install tmux from ports or pkgsrc or however you'd like to get it. 

Compile
	apt-get install libevent-dev libncurses5-dev
	tar xf tmux-2.0.tar.gz
	cd tmux-2.0
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

Let's SSH into the server, install tmux and fire it up.
	tmux

If you get disconnected while working in tmux, you can reconnect and run:
	tmux attach

And you'll be right back where you were! 
It's possible to split a terminal into multiple windows, open new tabs, 
reorder and close tabs and much more.
See the keybindings list for a complete list of things you can do.

Alternatively, you could keep a tmux session open on the server and just attach it on connect. 
That way you can have everything arranged just the way you left it on disconnect. 
Same applications running, multiple windows, splits, etc. 
And you don't even need to start a new shell on connect.
    ssh user@host -t tmux attach

You can add an alias for it.

    alias backtowork='ssh -t user@host tmux attach -t worksession'

The last argument allows you to attach a chosen session if you have more than one running.
