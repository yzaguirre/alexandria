OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) is a protocol for checking if a TLS certificate has been revoked.
In OCSP the browser sends a request to a OCSP URL and receives a response containing the validity status of the certificate.

When OCSP stapling is implemented the certificate holder (read web server) queries the OCSP server themselves and caches the response.
This response is "stapled" with the TLS/SSL Handshake via the Certificate Status Request extension response.

Check for OCSP stapling support
- Apache HTTP Server (>=2.3.3)
- Nginx (>=1.3.7)
	apache2 -v
	nginx -v

Retrieve the root CA and intermediate CA's certificate in PEM format and save them in a single file.
For Let's Encrypt:
	wget http://apps.identrust.com/roots/dstrootcax3.p7c
Better get DST Root CA X3 from the OS root certificate lists, and convert it from DER (binary DER with .cer file extension) to PEM
	openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -in dstrootcax3.cer -out dstrootcax3.pem
	wget https://letsencrypt.org/certs/lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem
	cat dstrootcax3.pem lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem > ca-cert-chain.pem

Configuring OCSP Stapling on Nginx
Edit conf file
	vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com.ssl
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;
ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/tls/private/ca-certs.pem;

Do a configtest to see if everything is correct.
	nginx -t
Restart nginx
	systemctl restart nginx
Check logs
	tail /var/log/nginx/error.log

You can use the openssl command-line program to verify that an OCSP response is sent by your server:
	openssl s_client -connect www.example.com:443 -status -servername www.example.com

Run a Qualys online SSL test
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html	

If the certificate does not point to an OCSP responder, or if a different address must be used
	openssl x509 -in ./www.example.com.crt -text | grep 'OCSP.*http'
