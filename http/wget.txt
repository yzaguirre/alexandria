If you need to go via a proxy server, the ~/.wgetrc file can be used to set proxy settings for the
wget tool.

	$ vim ~/.wgetrc
http_proxy = http://proxyserver.intranet.example.com:8080/
https_proxy = http://proxyserver.intranet.example.com:8080/
proxy_user = steve
proxy_password = letmein

You can also set equivalent variables in the shell.
The /etc/wgetrc fi le will be processed first, but is overruled by the user's ~/.wgetrc (if it exists).

You must use chmod 0600 ~/.wgetrc for ~/.wgetrc to be processed - this is for
your own protection; valid passwords should not be visible by anyone but your-
self! If the permissions are any more open than 0600, wget will ignore the file.

	$ chmod 0600 ~/.wgetrc
