	python3.9 -m pip install memray
You can invoke Memray the following way
	python3.9 -m memray
Or alternatively through the version-qualified memrayX.Y script
	memray3.9
You can also invoke Memray without version-qualifying it
	memray
Running the Analysis
	memray3.9 run example.py
This will execute the script and track its memory allocations,
displaying the name of the file where results are being recorded with a message like:
	Writing profile results into memray-example.py.4131.bin
Generating a Flame Graph
To generate a flame graph displaying memory usage across the application,
we can run memray flamegraph and specify the results file:
	memray3.9 flamegraph memray-example.py.4131.bin
