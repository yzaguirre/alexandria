PDFMiner is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents.
Unlike other PDF-related tools, it focuses entirely on getting and
analyzing text data. PDFMiner allows one to obtain the exact location
of text in a page, as well as other information such as fonts or lines.
It includes a PDF converter that can transform PDF files into other
text formats (such as HTML). It has an extensible PDF parser that can
be used for other purposes than text analysis.
