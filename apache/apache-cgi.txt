yum -y install httpd mod_perl
Create a home page by typing:
vi /var/www/html/index.html
Now create a link for Perl by typing:
ln -s /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/perl

Having completed these steps, we will now consider the need to configure the httpd
service for improved performance, security, and a few extra features. To do this, open
the httpd configuration file in your favorite text editor by typing:
vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Scroll down and find the following line:
ServerTokens OS
We do not want our server to relay any important information through the header so
change this line to read:
ServerTokens Prod

Now scroll down and find the following line:
KeepAlive Off
In order to enable a persistent connection we should change this line to read:
KeepAlive On

Now scroll down to find the following line:
ServerAdmin root@localhost
The traditional approach to set this value is based on the use of the webmaster
identity, so simply modify the e-mail address to reflect something more relevant to
your own needs. For example, if your server's domain name was www.henry.home
then your entry will look similar to this:
ServerAdmin webmaster@henry.home

Now scroll down a few more lines to find the ServerName directive as follows:
#ServerName www.example.com:80
Uncomment this line and replace the value www.example.com with something
more appropriate to your own needs. For example, if your server's domain name
was www.henry.home then your entry will look as follows:
ServerName www.henry.home:80


Now scroll down to find the following section:
# The Options directive is both complicated and important.
see
Please
# http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#options
# for more information
#
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

Change this to disable Indexes and enable CGI by making it as follows:
Options FollowSymLinks ExecCGI

If you would like to keep Indexes, simply modify the previous instruction in
the following way:
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI


Now find the following section:
# AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
# It can be "All", "None", or any combination of the keywords:
# Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
#
AllowOverride None

Change this to read as follows:
AllowOverride All

Now scroll down to find the following line:
DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var
Include a reference for CGI pages by making it as follows:
DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.cgi

You can use this opportunity to reorganize the order in a way that
pages are called and add new home page variations to suit your
own needs. For example, you could write the following:
index.html index.cgi welcome.html welcome.cgi


Now scroll down to find the following lines:
#CustomLog logs/access_log common
#CustomLog logs/referer_log referrer
#CustomLog logs/agent_log agent

To enable additional logging, simply uncomment them as follows:
CustomLog logs/access_log common
CustomLog logs/referer_log referrer
CustomLog logs/agent_log agent

For future reference, all log files for the httpd service
can be found at /var/log/httpd.

Now find the following line:
ServerSignature On
For reasons of security we do not want to expose the server's signature, so change
this to read as follows:
ServerSignature Off

Now scroll down to find the following line:
AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

We want the character set to be determined by the values used in our web pages,
so comment out this line in the following way:
#AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

Now scroll down to find the following line:
#AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
Uncomment this line to enable CGI and include a file reference for any other related
CGI-based extensions as follows:
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl

Having done this, simply save and close the file in the usual way before proceeding to
set the httpd service to start at boot by typing:
chkconfig httpd on

Now start the httpd service by typing the following command:
service httpd start
