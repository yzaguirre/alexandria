OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) is a protocol for checking if a TLS certificate has been revoked.
In OCSP the browser sends a request to a OCSP URL and receives a response containing the validity status of the certificate.

When OCSP stapling is implemented the certificate holder (read web server) queries the OCSP server themselves and caches the response.
This response is "stapled" with the TLS/SSL Handshake via the Certificate Status Request extension response.

Check for OCSP stapling support
- Apache HTTP Server (>=2.3.3)
- Nginx (>=1.3.7)
	apache2 -v
	nginx -v
CentOS/Fedora users replace apache2 with httpd.

Retrieve the root CA and intermediate CA's certificate in PEM format and save them in a single file.
For Let's Encrypt:
	wget http://apps.identrust.com/roots/dstrootcax3.p7c
Better get DST Root CA X3 from the OS root certificate lists, and convert it from DER (binary DER with .cer file extension) to PEM
	openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -in dstrootcax3.cer -out dstrootcax3.pem
	wget https://letsencrypt.org/certs/lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem
	cat dstrootcax3.pem lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem > ca-cert-chain.pem

Configuring OCSP Stapling on Apache
Notes:
- SSLCACertificateFile isn't used anymore. Relay on SSLCertificateFile specifying a pem with Intermediate Cert + Server Cert
- Don't add SSLUseStapling in sites-enabled/default-tls.conf
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ssl/ssl_howto.html#ocspstapling
Edit ssl.conf
	vim /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ssl.conf
SSLUseStapling On
SSLStaplingCache "shmcb:logs/ssl_stapling(32768)"
SSLStaplingCache shmcb:/tmp/stapling_cache(128000)

The path on the SSLStaplingCache directive (e.g., logs/) should match the one on the SSLSessionCache directive.
This path is relative to ServerRoot.

Do a configtest to check for errors.
	apachectl -t
Restart apache
	systemctl restart apache2.service

You can use the openssl command-line program to verify that an OCSP response is sent by your server:
	openssl s_client -connect www.example.com:443 -status -servername www.example.com

Run a Qualys online SSL test
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html	
	
If the certificate does not point to an OCSP responder, or if a different address must be used
	openssl x509 -in ./www.example.com.crt -text | grep 'OCSP.*http'
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslstaplingforceurl
If no OCSP URI is provided, contact your Certificate Authority to determine if one is available; if so, configure it with SSLStaplingForceURL in the virtual host that uses the certificate.

If multiple SSL-enabled virtual hosts are configured and OCSP Stapling should be disabled for some
Add SSLUseStapling Off to the virtual hosts for which OCSP Stapling should be disabled.
