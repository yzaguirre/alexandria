yum install mod_ssl
mkdir /etc/httpd/ssl

vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf

Scroll down to the section that begins with <VirtualHost _default_:443> and
locate the following line:
#ServerName www.example.com:443

Uncomment this line and modify the value shown to match the Common Name value
used during the creation of your certificate as follows:
ServerName www.mylocaldomain.home:443

Now make sure the following line reads as follows:
SSLEngine on

Following this, scroll down and find the line that looks as follows:
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt

Modify this line to reflect the location of your certificate as follows:
SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/ssl/apache.crt

Now scroll down and locate the following line:
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key

Again, modify this line to reflect the location of your server key as follows:
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/ssl/apache.key

When you have finished, simply save and close the file in the usual way before
protecting your files with the following command:
chmod 400 apache.*

Now restart the Apache httpd service:
service httpd restart

Well done, you can now visit your server with a secure connection by visiting the
https://www.myserverdomain.lan

Configure firewall
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
/sbin/service iptables save
iptables -L -v
