Backup strategies are a defense against data loss.

They are made up of multiple different components, like:
	a pre-defined schedule for backing up information
	The type of backup to be performed - full backup? incremental? automated?
	what needs to be backed up - the entire network? Specific drives or data?
	Backup and archive locations
Who is in charged that monitoring these backups are executing and who should have access to this data.
backup locations on type of data or office
how to secure the transfers
administer and monitor hardware use for these backups
who will be responsable for fault tolerence and availability, who will be in charge of replacing fail hardware
durability, fault tolerence and availability.
Critical data, understand the services we are using and fine print
Action plan in case you need backups, how long is an acceptable recovery time, how much data to restore, how much bandwith to use

protecting data in transit
client side encryption
encrypt data before we even send it out, to lets say, Amazon S3
Two options
	Use AWS KMS-Managed CMK
		Client gets a unique encryption key for each object

Security
	securing at rest, at transit
	server side encryption and access control. Before or after data has been transfered.
