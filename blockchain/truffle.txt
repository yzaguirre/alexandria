	mkdir election
	cd election
	truffle unbox pet-shop

Locate the local node
http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration
Edit truffle.js

Run a migration
	truffle migrate
Open truffle console
	truffle console
Get an instance of smart contract
	Election.deployed().then(function(instance){app = instance})
	app.address
Solidity makes a getter function for free, when the state variable
was declared with public access.
	app.candidate()

All data is inmutable. If the contract changes for dev purposes,
we must push a new copy of our contract to the local blockchain to get
our code changes. Even a new address is uses. Use reset flag.
	truffle migrate --reset
	truffle console
	Election.deployed().then(function(i){app = i})
	app.candidates(1)
	app.candidates(2)
	app.candidates(99)
	app.candidates(1).then(function(c) { candidate = c; })
	candidate[0] // id
	candidate[1] // name
	candidate[2] // voteCount

Run test
	truffle test
Run
	npm run dev
