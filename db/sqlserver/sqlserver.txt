Right click on Databases > Restore Database > General : Device: [the path of back up file] ---> OK

Before I created a database then restored the back up file to my new empty database. This was wrong. I shouldn't first create database.

Now I follow this:

Right click on Databases > Restore Database > General : Device: [the path of back up file] ---> OK
