Audio converter
http://libav.org/avconv.html

It breaks down into three major parts:
1) convert speech to text
	Record Text, from where?
	Android Phone
	From Desktop Mic
2) query database populated with q&a
3) convert text to speech
what it should do:
	api, soap, restful, encripted
	handle proxy
	handle ssh proxy
	search

In case you don't understand Perl, this is how you use the API:

POST to: https://www.google.com/speech-api/v1/recognize?xjerr=1&client=chromium&lang=en-US

POST params: Content (which should include the contents of a .flac encoding of your voice recorded in mono 16000hz or 8000hz)
Content_Type (which should read audio/x-flac; rate=16000? or 8000 depending on your voice recording. This should also be mirrored in the Content-Type section of your header.)

Response: json text

I used ffmpeg to convert my audio into the desired format:
	ffmpeg -i Memo.m4a -vn -ac 1 -ar 16000 -acodec flac test.flac

So I recorded my voice on my iphone 3gs asking "what day is it today?" and converted it to the appropriate .flac format and posted it to google's API and this is what I got in response:

{"status":0,"id":"008bd1a95c3c2b04bd754da5e82949f4-1","hypotheses":[{"utterance":"what day is it today","confidence":0.91573924}]}

Sweet.
