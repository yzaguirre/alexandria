You can serve a repository as a book using:
	gitbook serve ./repository

	gitbook pdf ./myrepo ./mybook.pdf

A book is a Git repository containing at least 2 files: README.md and SUMMARY.md.
README.md
Typically, this should be the introduction for your book. It will be automatically added to the final summary.

SUMMARY.md
The SUMMARY.md defines your book's structure. It should contain a list of chapters, linking to their respective pages.

warn: you should specify a gitbook version to use in your book.json, for example: 2.x.x
