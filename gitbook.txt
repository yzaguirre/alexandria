Create the directories and files for a book from its SUMMARY.md file (if existing) using
	gitbook init
You can serve a repository as a book using:
	gitbook serve ./repository
Or simply build the static website using:
	gitbook build ./repository ./outputFolder
Generate a PDF using:
	gitbook pdf ./myrepo ./mybook.pdf

A book is a Git repository containing at least 2 files: README.md and SUMMARY.md.
README.md
Typically, this should be the introduction for your book. It will be automatically added to the final summary.

SUMMARY.md
The SUMMARY.md defines your book's structure. It should contain a list of chapters, linking to their respective pages.

warn: you should specify a gitbook version to use in your book.json, for example: 2.x.x
