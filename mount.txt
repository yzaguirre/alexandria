To summarize, when it comes to ext3 or ext2 filesystem:
    USB Hard Drives = Ext3 or Ext2
    USB Flash Drives = Ext2 with "noatime" or "relatime" mount option

	blkid /dev/sdc1
Next in fstab, make a line like this:
	UUID=3272f388-ad6a-4ff5-9782-43388d0273ca /media/DA ext2 defaults,auto,umask=000,users,rw 0 0
Make the changes you need, but make sure you use your correct UUID(and remove the "") and it is set auto like above.
	mount -a

Ok, make sure you got udev installed. This is what's gonna automaticly mount our drives when new ones are detected. Make a new file;
	NoMore:/home# nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-mount.rules
And add the following line:
	SUBSYSTEM=="block", run+="/bin/mount -a"
Just make sure it uses the correct path to the mount command.
Next restart udev:
	NoMore:/home# /etc/init.d/udev restart
Now unmount(umount) your drive, unplug it and try it out.
