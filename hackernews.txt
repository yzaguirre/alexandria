HackerTray is a simple Hacker News Linux application that lets you view top HN stories in your System Tray. 
It relies on appindicator, so it is not guaranteed to work on all systems. 
It also provides a Gtk StatusIcon fallback in case AppIndicator is not available.
	# pip install hackertray
OR
	# easy_install hackertray
OR
#Download Source and cd to it
	# python setup.py install


After that, you can run 
	$ hackertray
from anywhere and it will run. 
You can now add it to your OS dependent session autostart method. 
In Ubuntu, you can access it via:
    System > Preferences > Sessions
    (OR)
    System > Preferences > Startup Applications
depending on your Ubuntu Version. 
Or put it in 
	~/.config/openbox/autostart 
if you are running OpenBox. Here is how the configuration should look like in Ubuntu and its derivatives.
