Use POST.

In 2010, using GET was probably an acceptable answer. But today (in 2013), browsers will pre-fetch pages they "think" you will visit next.

API Versioning
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/389169/best-practices-for-api-versioning
	
Using a version number in the URL should not be considered a bad practice when the underlying implementation changes.
"When the interface to a service changes in a non-backwards-compatible way, in reality an entirely new service has been created...From the client's perspective, a service is no more than an interface and some non-functional qualities...if the interface to a service changes in a non-backwards-compatible way, it no longer represents an instance of the original service, but is rather a completely new service."

Version numbers are defined as major.minor.revision which can have any arbitrary meaning, but generally when referring to applications:

    Revision = Bug fix
    Minor = Feature fixes and small adjustments
    Major = New features and other large changes

When referring to an API, a major upgrade is usually an interface change that will break users of the API. A minor upgrade is typically a change to the functionality behind API calls but the interface remains the same.
