println!("MAX_HEALTH is {:b} in binary", MAX_HEALTH);  // 1100100
The following formatting possibilities exist according to the type that must be printed:

o for octal
x for lower hexadecimal
X for upper hexadecimal
p for a pointer
b for binary
e for lower exponential notation
E for upper exponential notation
? for debugging purposes

The format! macro has the same parameters and works in the same way as println!, but it returns a string instead of printing out.
