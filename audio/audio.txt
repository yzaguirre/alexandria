List of all connected audio devices that ALSA knows about
	cat /proc/asound/cards
Control audio
	alsamixer
Control audio on other devce (found in asound folder)
	alsamixer -c1
You can easily switch between cards using the F6 or S keys

Switching between HDMI and analog audio output
Sets the audio out to the 3.5 mm analog jack.
	amixer cset numid=3 1: 
Sets the audio out to the HDMI cable.
	amixer cset numid=3 2: 

Install SoX and an add-on for dealing with MP3 files
	sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-mp3

Testing the speakers
	speaker-test -c2 -t wav

To save a recording to a file named myrec.wav on the SD card
	sox -t alsa plughw:1 myrec.wav
Play back the recording using the following command
	sox myrec.wav -d
If your USB gadget happens to have speakers, like a headset, you could listen
to the recording in the headphones with the following command:
	sox myrec.wav -t alsa plughw:1

Writing to an MP3 or OGG file
Type in the following command to install the LAME encoder (for MP3) and the
Vorbis encoder (for OGG)
	sudo apt-get install lame vorbis-tools

To encode myrec.wav to myrec.mp3
	lame myrec.wav
To encode myrec.wav to myrec.ogg
	oggenc myrec.wav

Record straight to an MP3 or OGG file
	sox -t alsa plughw:1 -t wav - | lame - myrec.mp3
	sox -t alsa plughw:1 -t wav - | oggenc - -o myrec.ogg
You can then play back these formats with sox just like any other file:
	sox myrec.mp3 -d

Make alias
	alias record='sox -t alsa plughw:1 -t wav - | lame -'
	alias micmaxvol='amixer -c1 sset Mic 100'
Now all you have to do to start recording to the newrec.mp3 file is type in
the following:
	record newrec.mp3
Now, to send the audio from our microphone to the speakers on the Pi, use
the following command
	sox -d -d
	sox -d -t sox - | ssh rasp sox -q -t sox - -d

	cat ~/"Desktop/My Song.mp3" | ssh pi@[IP address] sox -t mp3 - -d
	cat ~/"Desktop/My Album/"*.mp3 | ssh pi@[IP address] sox -t mp3 - -d


Tired of your own voice by now? Let's make it more interesting by applying some
interesting SoX effects!
	sox --help-effect=all

In this example, we'll start a monitoring loop on the Pi and apply a reverb effect to
our voice, live as it plays back through the speakers:
	sox -t alsa plughw:1 -d reverb
How about that? Sounds like we're stuck in a cave. Let's see what parameters the
reverb effect takes:
	sox -t alsa plughw:1 -d reverb ?
Normal record
	sox -t alsa plughw:0 myvoice.wav

Make it talk
espeak "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
espeak -f /etc/motd -v french
ls | espeak --stdout | sox -t wav - -d reverb 99 50 0
echo "It's a UNIX system. I know this." | espeak -w iknow.wav

Finally, to get a list of the different voices available, use 
	espeak --voices
	espeak --voices=es

An automated SoX recording will continue to run until the Pi runs out of SD card
space. We can use the trim effect to stop the recording (or playback) after a certain
amount of time has elapsed:
	sox -t alsa plughw:1 myrec.wav trim 0 00:30:00

Super fast fixed-point MP3 encoder.
