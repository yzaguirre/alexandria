Rasdaemon is a RAS (Reliability, Availability and Serviceability) logging tool.
It records memory errors, using the EDAC tracing events.
EDAC is a Linux kernel subsystem with handles detection of ECC errors
from memory controllers for most chipsets on i386 and x86_64 architectures.
EDAC drivers for other architectures like arm also exists.
